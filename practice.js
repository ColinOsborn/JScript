function makeSandwich(filling) {
  // add in psuedo code here;
}

// much like when ending a sentence with a period, but instead of a period
// you'll use a semi-colon; Don't forget those semi-colons;
// typically can put semi-colons at the end of every line, however, not the ending function line
// but when inside of the function, should end with semi-colon

// makeSandwich(ham)
console.log(ham)
